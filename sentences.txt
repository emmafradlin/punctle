0100011|medium|After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey.
0100011|medium|Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short.
0100011|easy|No, comrades, a thousand times no!
0100011|easy|There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems.
0100011|hard|To that horror we all must come-cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone.
0100011|easy|That is my message to you, comrades: Rebellion!
0100011|medium|They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on.
0100011|hard|Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on-that is, badly.
0100011|easy|They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time.
0100011|easy|Some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate.
0100011|easy|Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure!
0100011|medium|The plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail.
0100011|medium|Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it?
0100011|easy|This, said Squealer, was something called tactics.
0100011|easy|Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled.
0100011|easy|When captured, he said, Frederick should be boiled alive.
0100011|medium|A cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded.
0100011|easy|There were more songs, more speeches, more processions.
0100011|medium|Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead.
0100011|medium|This, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been buried.
0100011|medium|There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials.

0100021|medium|It was safer; though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing.
0100021|hard|The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts.
0100021|hard|Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.
0100021|easy|In small clumsy letters he wrote: April 4th, 1984.
0100021|easy|That, it was true, was very unlikely.
0100021|hard|All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching.
0100021|easy|You were abolished, annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.
0100021|easy|Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past.
0100021|hard|Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed-no escape.
0100021|easy|Such things, he saw, could not happen today.
0100021|hard|Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows.
0100021|medium|His mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them.
0100021|medium|Someone whom the old man loved-a little granddaughter, perhaps-had been killed.
0100021|medium|The past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed.
0100021|easy|Withers, however, was already an UNPERSON.
0100021|hard|And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue-a quite bright blue.
0100021|medium|There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity.
0100021|medium|Goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago.
0100021|easy|Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
0100021|medium|It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible.
0100021|easy|The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion.
0100021|hard|It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note.
0100021|easy|Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph.
0100021|easy|They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.
0100021|medium|It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant.
0100021|medium|You-the ordinary people, the workers-were their slaves.
0100021|hard|Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians-all sorts there was.
0100021|easy|In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.
0100021|easy|Yes, he thought again, he would come back.
0100021|hard|Banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff.
0100021|easy|For whom, for what, was that bird singing?
0100021|easy|Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine!
0100021|hard|The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying, protecting feeling.
0100021|easy|It paid, she said, it was camouflage.
0100021|hard|Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly.
0100021|easy|Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.
0100021|hard|He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass.
0100021|easy|Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal.
0100021|hard|There was a long, nagging argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings.
0100021|easy|Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden.
0100021|medium|He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what?
0100021|medium|Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about.
0100021|hard|But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable.
0100021|easy|Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed.
0100021|hard|After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low.
0100021|easy|The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one.
0100021|easy|The problem, that is to say, is educational.
0100021|easy|CRIMESTOP, in short, means protective stupidity.
0100021|hard|In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane.
0100021|medium|But it was so, and after all, he thought, why not?
0100021|easy|How small, thought Winston, how small it always was!
0100021|easy|Twenty minutes, an hour-it was difficult to judge.
0100021|easy|Not brainy, of course, but keen.
0100021|easy|It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.
0100021|medium|We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories.
0100021|hard|The fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.
0100021|medium|Later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called.
0100021|easy|It must be he, Winston, who was mad.
0100021|medium|Over the body-but, above all, over the mind.
0100021|medium|Power over matter-external reality, as you would call it-is not important.
0100021|easy|There will be no art, no literature, no science.
0100021|hard|The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease.
0100021|hard|Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive.
0100021|easy|Nine, ten, eleven teeth left.
0100021|easy|How intelligent, he thought, how intelligent!
0100021|easy|Everything was settled, smoothed out, reconciled.
0100021|medium|There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more pain, no more fear.
0100021|hard|It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths.
0100021|easy|That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.
0100021|medium|It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held immovably.
0100021|easy|He was blind, helpless, mindless.
0100021|hard|And then-no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope.
0100021|easy|Always, without exception, it is so arranged.
0100021|hard|It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruction of the Party!
0100021|easy|It was his life, his death, and his resurrection.
0100021|easy|The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.
0100021|hard|DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT, or LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.
0100021|medium|A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them.

pg76|easy|Well, then, the old thing commenced again.
pg76|easy|Oh, yes, you got a gun.
pg76|medium|The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.
pg76|hard|Well, before long, here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down!
pg76|hard|Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger.
pg76|medium|I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.
pg76|easy|Well, that was all easy, so we done it.
pg76|easy|Admission 25 cents; children and servants, 10 cents.
pg76|easy|Oh, no, I reckon not!
pg76|easy|Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?
pg76|medium|And, my souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.
pg76|easy|Why, yonder he is, now.
pg76|medium|Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.
pg76|easy|Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.
pg76|hard|He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so: 1.

pg84|easy|Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?
pg84|hard|If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet.
pg84|easy|Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret.
pg84|easy|This, briefly, is his story.
pg84|easy|I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.
pg84|hard|I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.
pg84|hard|One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.
pg84|easy|Her ugly sister, Manon, married M.
pg84|easy|Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.
pg84|easy|And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?
pg84|easy|Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?
pg84|easy|Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.
pg84|hard|You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
pg84|easy|Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.
pg84|medium|I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.
pg84|hard|You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?
pg84|hard|Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
pg84|hard|Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.
pg84|hard|Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.
pg84|hard|Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?
pg84|hard|I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
pg84|easy|She fell, however, into good hands.
pg84|medium|Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?
pg84|medium|Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.
pg84|easy|Such a monster has, then, really existence!
pg84|medium|Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?
pg84|easy|Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?
pg84|hard|No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.
pg84|hard|I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.

pg1184|easy|Look, Fernand, your eyes are better than mine.
pg1184|hard|My friends will be there, I hope; that is to say, you are invited, M.
pg1184|hard|Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every difficulty has been removed.
pg1184|easy|Old Dantès, however, sprang forward.
pg1184|hard|If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person; and that, you know, is Fernand.
pg1184|hard|As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too hasty; but I have striven to repress it.
pg1184|easy|Tomorrow, perhaps, he may change you.
pg1184|hard|Sire, the usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible.
pg1184|easy|I am, indeed, to be pitied.
pg1184|easy|Well, sir, what you tell me is impossible.
pg1184|medium|Unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them.
pg1184|medium|He used to weep, he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat.
pg1184|medium|Unhappy he, who, on the brink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!
pg1184|hard|All his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.
pg1184|easy|The jailer, therefore, only grumbled.
pg1184|medium|Another had done all this; why, then, was it impossible to Dantès?
pg1184|easy|No, be assured, I am not mad.
pg1184|medium|This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted.
pg1184|medium|Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you!
pg1184|medium|He remained, therefore, mute and motionless, hardly venturing to breathe.
pg1184|easy|Oh, my God, I have suffered enough surely!
pg1184|medium|An instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards him.
pg1184|medium|The four seamen, who composed the crew, obeyed, while the pilot looked on.
pg1184|easy|The point was, then, to discover the hidden entrance.
pg1184|easy|He found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless.
pg1184|medium|Dantès approached the upper rock, which now, without any support, leaned towards the sea.
pg1184|easy|Dantès turned pale, hesitated, and reflected.
pg1184|medium|He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.
pg1184|easy|Dantès, meanwhile, went on his way.
pg1184|hard|In the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who, uneasy herself, had anticipated her mother.
pg1184|easy|You have a calm, strong mind, Maximilian.
pg1184|hard|If, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man.
pg1184|medium|They were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated courtesans.
pg1184|medium|Moreover, other ideas, much more enthralling, occupied his mind.
pg1184|hard|The curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a present of pens, paper, and a penknife.
pg1184|hard|Cucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had carried the maiden off.
pg1184|medium|He was standing, his arms folded, near Rita, who was still insensible.
pg1184|hard|Andrea was short and fat; his visage, marked with brutal cruelty, did not indicate age; he might be thirty.
pg1184|easy|Albert, in his turn, sat behind.
pg1184|hard|Your offer, however, smooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M.
pg1184|medium|I shall come back to dessert; keep me some strawberries, coffee, and cigars.
pg1184|hard|I beg you, therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish, too Italian, or too Arabian.
pg1184|easy|Come, gentlemen, let us all propose some place.
pg1184|easy|He knows my tastes, my caprices, my wants.
pg1184|easy|France will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful.
pg1184|hard|This house, isolated from the rest, had, besides the main entrance, another in the Rue de Ponthieu.
pg1184|hard|Monte Cristo, on the contrary, took the right hand; arrived near a clump of trees, he stopped.
pg1184|medium|At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to Arles.
pg1184|hard|Three brigands, called Trestaillon, Truphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapartism.
pg1184|hard|Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is, that I will kill you.
pg1184|medium|Nothing, then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined the grounds.
pg1184|hard|Joannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45.
pg1184|medium|Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you, and, perhaps, to others.
pg1184|easy|Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your mind.
pg1184|medium|As Bertuccio, with a respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back.
pg1184|medium|As for the Théatre Français, you know, of course, that it is nowhere.
pg1184|easy|That happened, as I told you, in 1829.
pg1184|medium|Let us, then, hope for the best; hope is so sweet a comforter.
pg1184|hard|Science loves eccentricities, leaps and bounds, trials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term them.
pg1184|medium|He had a remarkably fine garden, full of vegetables, flowers, and fruit.
pg1184|medium|So, then, the rabbit dies, and justice takes no notice.
pg1184|easy|Why, to converse with him, of course.
pg1184|easy|Several persons are invited, and among others, M.
pg1184|hard|My brother Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore, be poor in comparison with me.
pg1184|easy|Indeed, almost before the door opened, the scene changed.
pg1184|easy|I, indeed, invited them here today on your account.
pg1184|medium|Your tilbury, your groom, your clothes, are not then hired?
pg1184|easy|Stop there, madame, for this cannot last.
pg1184|easy|You look careworn; really, you alarm me.
pg1184|easy|Spare me, then, I beseech you.
pg1184|easy|Alas, no, I know not.
pg1184|hard|Never, till then, had I placed any confidence in presentiments, but now I cannot help believing them, Valentine.
pg1184|medium|Franz, to provoke him, and to fight with him; all that would be folly.
pg1184|easy|Live, Maximilian, and I will be yours.
pg1184|easy|On him, on him, always on him!
pg1184|medium|Yes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you.
pg1184|easy|The general, who had almost fainted, revived.
pg1184|medium|Andrea had, then, in a fortnight, attained a very fair position.
pg1184|easy|Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo.
pg1184|easy|However, he remained standing, clinging to a window.
pg1184|easy|The Lemonade Morrel was, in fact, very happy.
pg1184|easy|All these women had been, or were, beautiful.
pg1184|hard|Ah, yes; you look at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each.
pg1184|medium|Well, my friend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said.
pg1184|easy|Do I, for instance, fare better?
pg1184|easy|Caderousse, terrified, looked at the count.
pg1184|easy|But, once started, he could not stop.
pg1184|easy|My God, my Lord, I have long despised thee!
pg1184|medium|Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?
pg1184|medium|Oh, Beauchamp, Beauchamp, how shall I now approach mine?
pg1184|easy|Silence, purveyor of gossip, do not spread that report.
pg1184|easy|Albert bathed, took his supper, and went to bed.
pg1184|easy|No, Albert, take my advice.
pg1184|easy|Why, you are mad, Albert!
pg1184|hard|Then, the effort having exhausted her strength, she fell, not asleep this time, but fainting on the floor.
pg1184|hard|Moreover, do not alarm yourself, Morrel; this weakness, if it is such, is betrayed to you alone.
pg1184|easy|You had friends, Albert; break off their acquaintance.
pg1184|hard|Albert took the letter, opened, and read it, then looked round for Bertuccio, but he was gone.
pg1184|easy|Your mother, Albert, knows that poor house well.
pg1184|medium|Are you not the Captain Fernand who betrayed, sold, and murdered his benefactor, Ali?
pg1184|easy|Maximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her.
pg1184|easy|Death is now, perhaps, striking a fourth blow.
pg1184|easy|Have you, then, power against death?
pg1184|hard|This new tenant, who, as we have said, was an Italian, was called Il Signor Giacomo Busoni.
pg1184|medium|I actually love no one, sir; you know it, do you not?
pg1184|easy|No, indeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected.
pg1184|hard|Andrea, surrounded by his friends, complimented, flattered, beginning to believe in the reality of his dream, was almost bewildered.
pg1184|hard|There was, indeed, reason to retreat, to be alarmed, and to scream.
pg1184|easy|Debray, perhaps, as it was once proposed.
pg1184|easy|Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs.
pg1184|hard|He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook the curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.
pg1184|easy|Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.
pg1184|medium|At twenty minutes to twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting, returned home.
pg1184|medium|No, madame; the law has commanded, and when it commands it strikes.
pg1184|medium|No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!
pg1184|easy|The nails, too, were turning blue.
pg1184|medium|On a sudden she stepped, or rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table.
pg1184|easy|His glance, at first wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel.
pg1184|medium|Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence.
pg1184|easy|The two doctors, therefore, entered the room alone.
pg1184|medium|Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent as the corpse.
pg1184|easy|Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free.
pg1184|easy|Has Lamoricière, that Ney of the South, been killed?
pg1184|easy|Has Morrel, whom we know, been killed?
pg1184|easy|And, then, to be here so young!
pg1184|medium|Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game of pincette.
pg1184|easy|Oh, my brain whirls; I no longer understand anything.
pg1184|hard|Everyone, therefore, ran to the court; some to witness the sight, others to comment upon it.
pg1184|easy|This strange, unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your reason.
pg1184|easy|The horses, impelled by fear, flew towards the house.
pg1184|hard|He took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called him, but the child made no response.
pg1184|hard|Oh, no, Edmond, it is myself that I blame, myself that I hate!
pg1184|easy|I live, as it were, between two graves.
pg1184|easy|Oh, those figures, how well I remember them!
pg1184|hard|He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a tomb, and sought it vainly.
pg1184|medium|One day he miraculously left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful.
pg1184|medium|Old Pastrini, our former acquaintance, received the traveller at the door, hat in hand.
pg1184|hard|Danglars, astonished, opened the door; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled on.
pg1184|hard|He no longer possessed strength, will, power, or feeling; he followed where they led him.
pg1184|medium|Ali, mute and attentive, brought the pipes and coffee, and disappeared.
pg1184|medium|Morrel, overpowered, turned around in the armchair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein.

pg1260|medium|They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.
pg1260|medium|Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?
pg1260|easy|Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.
pg1260|hard|Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged.
pg1260|easy|November, December, and half of January passed away.
pg1260|hard|The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs.
pg1260|easy|And why has she, or any other, curled hair?
pg1260|medium|She wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment.
pg1260|easy|And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?
pg1260|easy|Bless you, child; what an idea!
pg1260|medium|It was a curious laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless.
pg1260|easy|Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.
pg1260|easy|October, November, December passed away.
pg1260|easy|The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind.
pg1260|hard|My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation.
pg1260|medium|I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
pg1260|easy|The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
pg1260|hard|Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within the chamber.
pg1260|easy|Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?
pg1260|hard|There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the impression of a much larger number.
pg1260|medium|She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.
pg1260|easy|I regarded her, of course, with special interest.
pg1260|easy|It was not, however, so saturnine a pride!
pg1260|easy|Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!
pg1260|hard|If you knew it, you are peculiarly situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.
pg1260|hard|They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.
pg1260|hard|Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself carefully.
pg1260|easy|I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.
pg1260|easy|God, who does the work, ordains the instrument.
pg1260|easy|They were very cold, indeed, at first.
pg1260|hard|Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?
pg1260|easy|Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?
pg1260|hard|When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.
pg1260|hard|He is a proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked money.
pg1260|easy|He, too, has always been called careful.
pg1260|hard|I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned; I omens did defy: Whatever menaced, harassed, warned, I passed impetuous by.
pg1260|hard|Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well.
pg1260|hard|Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret to him, you shall share the confidence.
pg1260|medium|It was he: here he was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.
pg1260|hard|He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well as a long, strong arm.
pg1260|easy|Sophie, I supposed, had come in.
pg1260|medium|And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.
pg1260|easy|Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.
pg1260|hard|Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet us.
pg1260|hard|I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.
pg1260|easy|I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?
pg1260|easy|Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.
pg1260|easy|Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble!
pg1260|hard|I found her a fine woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.
pg1260|hard|I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.
pg1260|hard|She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome.
pg1260|hard|Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to my taste.
pg1260|medium|Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely.
pg1260|medium|Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!
pg1260|medium|It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.
pg1260|medium|He would feel himself forsaken; his love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.
pg1260|easy|I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly.
pg1260|hard|Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
pg1260|easy|As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered.
pg1260|hard|As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.
pg1260|medium|Thus lodged, I was not, at least at the commencement of the night, cold.
pg1260|hard|Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear.
pg1260|easy|What a still, hot, perfect day!
pg1260|hard|Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities.
pg1260|easy|In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning.
pg1260|medium|It burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.
pg1260|medium|Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir.
pg1260|easy|Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror!
pg1260|medium|She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both with power and goodness.
pg1260|easy|Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.
pg1260|hard|He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to herself.
pg1260|medium|I examined, first, the parlour, and then its occupant.
pg1260|easy|This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?
pg1260|medium|To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.
pg1260|hard|I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced.
pg1260|hard|Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.
pg1260|medium|Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.
pg1260|medium|Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
pg1260|hard|Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to teach.
pg1260|medium|He lifted his gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it on her.
pg1260|easy|An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was.
pg1260|hard|Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not, conceal it from her.
pg1260|easy|Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?
pg1260|hard|I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul.
pg1260|medium|I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.
pg1260|medium|It aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
pg1260|easy|One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah!
pg1260|hard|Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death, Funeral.
pg1260|hard|Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
pg1260|easy|Now, I did not like this, reader.
pg1260|easy|I, for instance, am but dust and ashes.
pg1260|easy|That, too, is very clear to my vision.
pg1260|medium|Your words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.
pg1260|medium|I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.
pg1260|easy|I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your housekeeper.
pg1260|medium|Cheered, as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.
pg1260|easy|I would not, therefore, immediately charm the snake.
pg1260|hard|He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg.
pg1260|hard|He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him.
pg1260|hard|Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating.
pg1260|medium|His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.
pg1260|hard|My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love are happy likewise.

pg1342|hard|He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.
pg1342|easy|The distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly.
pg1342|easy|They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.
pg1342|easy|But, however, he did not.
pg1342|easy|The loo table, however, did not appear.
pg1342|easy|No, no; I feel he may defy us there.
pg1342|medium|I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
pg1342|hard|On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.
pg1342|easy|Lydia, my love, ring the bell.
pg1342|easy|Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.
pg1342|medium|Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
pg1342|easy|Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.
pg1342|easy|Society, I own, is necessary to me.
pg1342|hard|She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished.
pg1342|medium|Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
pg1342|medium|Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.
pg1342|easy|Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.
pg1342|easy|His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.
pg1342|hard|Bennet; and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.
pg1342|hard|Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces.
pg1342|easy|The Lucases are very artful people, indeed, sister.
pg1342|easy|Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.
pg1342|easy|I pity, though I cannot help blaming, her.
pg1342|easy|Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.
pg1342|easy|Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.
pg1342|easy|Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?
pg1342|medium|She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.
pg1342|easy|My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!
pg1342|easy|Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.
pg1342|medium|Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.
pg1342|hard|Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
pg1342|easy|But vanity, not love, has been my folly.
pg1342|easy|They were ignorant, idle, and vain.
pg1342|easy|Mamma would like to go, too, of all things!
pg1342|hard|Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
pg1342|easy|There was another reason, too, for her opposition.
pg1342|easy|Well, well, I only hope it will last.
pg1342|medium|Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!
pg1342|easy|To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
pg1342|easy|Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
pg1342|easy|Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.
pg1342|medium|Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
pg1342|medium|Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.
pg1342|easy|They were, therefore, to go.
pg1342|medium|Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
pg1342|easy|Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.
pg1342|easy|I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.
pg1342|medium|I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.
pg1342|easy|If, indeed, it should be so!
pg1342|easy|But, really, I know not what to say.
pg1342|easy|Oh, brother, how kind you are!
pg1342|easy|Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.
pg1342|medium|Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.
pg1342|easy|Stay, stay, I will go myself.
pg1342|easy|Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.
pg1342|easy|Other schemes, too, came into her head.
pg1342|medium|She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.
pg1342|hard|Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.
pg1342|hard|Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.
pg1342|medium|You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.
pg1342|easy|Not one party, or scheme, or anything!
pg1342|hard|To be sure, London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.
pg1342|medium|I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.
pg1342|medium|But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or Jane at most.
pg1342|easy|He had, to be sure, done much.
pg1342|easy|He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
pg1342|medium|She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head, by turns.
pg1342|medium|But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.
pg1342|easy|It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
pg1342|easy|Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
pg1342|easy|Come, be quick, be quick!
pg1342|medium|You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
pg1342|easy|You refuse, then, to oblige me.
pg1342|medium|They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.
pg1342|easy|Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.
pg1342|medium|But, Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.
pg1342|medium|The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.
pg1342|easy|He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.

pg1400|hard|Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea.
pg1400|medium|Within myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice.
pg1400|medium|She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.
pg1400|medium|It was very dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along.
pg1400|medium|Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after another, but without avail.
pg1400|easy|Then, and after that, I took it.
pg1400|easy|In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew.
pg1400|easy|You are envious, Biddy, and grudging.
pg1400|easy|Miss Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child.
pg1400|easy|Jane, you undutiful little thing, go and lie down.
pg1400|easy|I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.
pg1400|hard|Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair.
pg1400|medium|My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve.
pg1400|hard|Therefore we had sat, feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear.
pg1400|easy|Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared.
pg1400|medium|Now, that handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own.
pg1400|hard|Let my body be where it would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that house.
pg1400|hard|It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud, mud, deep in all the streets.
pg1400|easy|Why, look at you, dear boy!
pg1400|easy|And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed!
pg1400|medium|Yes, he said; at different times of the night, three.
pg1400|easy|Now, go on, dear boy.
pg1400|medium|This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own account, to Little Britain.
pg1400|easy|Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!
pg1400|hard|It is not a fortunate discovery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune, anything.
pg1400|hard|You, so young, untried, and beautiful, Estella!
pg1400|easy|How anxious, how dismal, how long!
pg1400|medium|Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought, in black.
pg1400|medium|But, to any mind, I thought, the connection here was clear and straight.
pg1400|easy|So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!
pg1400|medium|The falser he, the truer Joe; the meaner he, the nobler Joe.
pg1400|hard|And why, do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand unto him?
pg1400|hard|No gleam of fire, no glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.

pg1533|medium|Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none: So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
pg1533|easy|Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
pg1533|easy|What, sir, not yet at rest?
pg1533|easy|Thanks, sir: the like to you.
pg1533|hard|Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
pg1533|hard|Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.
pg1533|hard|What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?
pg1533|easy|How goes the world, sir, now?
pg1533|easy|They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
pg1533|easy|We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us.
pg1533|easy|Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
pg1533|hard|So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.
pg1533|easy|O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
pg1533|medium|Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time, We will require her welcome.
pg1533|easy|His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise.
pg1533|easy|Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.
pg1533|medium|To all, and him, we thirst, And all to all.
pg1533|medium|I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him.
pg1533|hard|Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.
pg1533|medium|How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
pg1533|easy|Come, high or low; Thyself and office deftly show!
pg1533|easy|Be bloody, bold, and resolute.
pg1533|easy|Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
pg1533|medium|Show his eyes, and grieve his heart; Come like shadows, so depart!
pg1533|easy|Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
pg1533|easy|What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
pg1533|easy|Alas, poor country, Almost afraid to know itself!
pg1533|easy|O, relation Too nice, and yet too true!
pg1533|medium|Wife, children, servants, all That could be found.
pg1533|easy|That, sir, which I will not report after her.
pg1533|medium|This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep.
pg1533|easy|For certain, sir, he is not.
pg1533|easy|The Queen, my lord, is dead.
pg1533|easy|Hail, King, for so thou art.

pg2701|medium|Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.
pg2701|medium|A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.
pg2701|easy|And what is it, thought I, after all!
pg2701|hard|It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.
pg2701|easy|Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.
pg2701|hard|No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
pg2701|easy|There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here.
pg2701|medium|The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry.
pg2701|hard|And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.
pg2701|medium|Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator.
pg2701|hard|What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood!
pg2701|easy|Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers.
pg2701|easy|I say, Quohog, blast ye!
pg2701|easy|Morning to ye, shipmates, morning!
pg2701|easy|Well, call all hands, then.
pg2701|hard|Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
pg2701|easy|Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington!
pg2701|hard|Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real dignity in whaling.
pg2701|medium|Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it.
pg2701|easy|But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright.
pg2701|medium|Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev.
pg2701|hard|As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature.
pg2701|easy|In his System of Nature, A.D.
pg2701|hard|But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
pg2701|easy|So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.
pg2701|easy|He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.
pg2701|hard|Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected.
pg2701|hard|Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!
pg2701|hard|In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences.
pg2701|medium|What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now?
pg2701|easy|All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks.
pg2701|medium|But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself.
pg2701|easy|The crew, man, the crew!
pg2701|easy|So, so; it goes round excellently.
pg2701|easy|Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.
pg2701|easy|Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.
pg2701|easy|Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear?
pg2701|hard|Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly!
pg2701|easy|Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one.
pg2701|medium|Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!
pg2701|easy|So, be cheery, my lads!
pg2701|easy|Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears.
pg2701|medium|Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.
pg2701|easy|Up, spine, and meet it!
pg2701|easy|Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal yard!
pg2701|easy|Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls!
pg2701|medium|So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.
pg2701|easy|Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.
pg2701|easy|Well, well, so be it!
pg2701|medium|Softly, softly, and steadily, my men.
pg2701|easy|Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.
pg2701|hard|Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
pg2701|easy|However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing.
pg2701|hard|But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
pg2701|easy|Well then, Don, refill my cup.
pg2701|medium|For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.
pg2701|hard|After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.
pg2701|hard|Soon it went down, and while, with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo!
pg2701|easy|But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last.
pg2701|easy|Your hat, however, is the most convenient.
pg2701|medium|Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.
pg2701|easy|So, in productive subjects, grow the chapters.
pg2701|easy|Away, cook, and deliver my message.
pg2701|easy|Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders.
pg2701|easy|Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating.
pg2701|easy|Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.
pg2701|hard|He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair.
pg2701|easy|A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
pg2701|medium|Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.
pg2701|easy|So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us.
pg2701|hard|Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them, and lay together our own.
pg2701|easy|How is it, then, with the whale?
pg2701|medium|But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?
pg2701|easy|Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.
pg2701|hard|The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.
pg2701|easy|A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man.
pg2701|easy|It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.
pg2701|easy|His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched.
pg2701|medium|With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
pg2701|medium|Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela!
pg2701|medium|Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent.
pg2701|medium|Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.
pg2701|hard|Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will.
pg2701|easy|Mark this, too, in the whaler.
pg2701|easy|My God, men, stand by!
pg2701|hard|And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.
pg2701|easy|No; he did not mean to, at least.
pg2701|hard|And an idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was.
pg2701|easy|Off hatch, then, and start her.
pg2701|medium|A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.
pg2701|medium|This done, the hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
pg2701|medium|Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.
pg2701|medium|This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me.
pg2701|hard|Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb.
pg2701|medium|The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
pg2701|medium|In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came.
pg2701|hard|They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings.
pg2701|medium|How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan?
pg2701|hard|But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.
pg2701|hard|Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench.
pg2701|easy|So, so; it does pinch some.
pg2701|easy|There, take the order, and away.
pg2701|medium|No, no, no; I must have a lantern.
pg2701|easy|Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
pg2701|easy|I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
pg2701|easy|Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now.
pg2701|hard|Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair, do I.
pg2701|medium|To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.
pg2701|medium|I say; game, game, game!
pg2701|easy|Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
pg2701|easy|But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
pg2701|medium|Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.
pg2701|medium|Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!
pg2701|easy|Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou must!
pg2701|medium|A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.
pg2701|medium|The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?
pg2701|medium|I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.
pg2701|hard|Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.
pg2701|easy|Never mind; catch the turn there, and pass it.
pg2701|hard|Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now.
pg2701|medium|Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest.
pg2701|medium|Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.
pg2701|easy|Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!
pg2701|medium|These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging slow.
pg2701|easy|Come, then, to my cabin.
pg2701|easy|But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.
pg2701|medium|God bless ye, man, and may I forgive myself, but I must go.
pg2701|medium|Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs!
pg2701|medium|In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished.
pg2701|easy|Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!
pg2701|medium|Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.
pg2701|medium|But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck?
pg2701|hard|I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise.
pg2701|medium|Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!
pg2701|medium|Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm?
pg2701|easy|No, no; only black water!
pg2701|medium|Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale!
pg2701|hard|In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
pg2701|easy|Believe ye, men, in the things called omens?
pg2701|medium|Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.
pg2701|easy|Aye, aye, it must be so.
pg2701|easy|Aye, aye, I have run him by last night.
pg2701|medium|So, so; he travels fast, and I must down.
pg2701|hard|But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship?
pg2701|easy|Away, mates, to the ship!
pg2701|hard|Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work.
pg2701|medium|Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!

pg25344|medium|It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak impersonally.
pg25344|easy|His countenance, in this repose, was mild and kindly.
pg25344|hard|Such an exhibition, however, was but to be pictured in fancy; not to be anticipated, nor desired.
pg25344|medium|I cared not, at this period, for books; they were apart from me.
pg25344|hard|Meagre, indeed, and cold was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such bystanders, at the scaffold.
pg25344|hard|He was small in stature, with a furrowed visage, which, as yet, could hardly be termed aged.
pg25344|easy|Very soon, however, his look became keen and penetrative.
pg25344|medium|They were, doubtless, good men, just and sage.
pg25344|easy|What say you to it, once again, Brother Dimmesdale?
pg25344|easy|Thou and thine, Hester Prynne, belong to me.
pg25344|medium|Recognize me not, by word, by sign, by look!
pg25344|medium|His fame, his position, his life, will be in my hands.
pg25344|hard|It appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself.
pg25344|easy|Little Pearl, of course, was her companion.
pg25344|hard|The victory accomplished, Pearl returned quietly to her mother, and looked up, smiling, into her face.
pg25344|easy|That, surely, were a shallow view of it.
pg25344|easy|Come away, mother, or he will catch you!
pg25344|medium|Your pardon, once again, good Sir, if my speech give the shadow of offence.
pg25344|medium|He, if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill!
pg25344|medium|But, with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror!
pg25344|medium|It mattered little, for his object, whether celestial, or from what other region.
pg25344|medium|He won it, indeed, in great part, by his sorrows.
pg25344|easy|Why, then, had he come hither?
pg25344|medium|But, indeed, he was blind and foolish, as he ever and always is.
pg25344|hard|My old faith, long forgotten, comes back to me, and explains all that we do, and all we suffer.
pg25344|easy|There it is, playing, a good way off.
pg25344|easy|But, mother, tell me now!
pg25344|easy|Woman, woman, thou art accountable for this!
pg25344|medium|Heaven, likewise, had frowned upon her, and she had not died.
pg25344|hard|Here, seen only by her eyes, Arthur Dimmesdale, false to God and man, might be, for one moment, true!
pg25344|easy|Will he continue, then, to keep our secret?
pg25344|hard|Had she gathered pearls, and diamonds, and rubies, in the wood, they could not have become her better.
pg25344|hard|But see, mother, how many faces of strange people, and Indians among them, and sailors!
pg25344|hard|Not the less, however, the great, honest face of the people smiled, grimly, perhaps, but widely too.
pg25344|medium|The change may be for good or ill, and is partly, perhaps, for both.
pg25344|medium|But, truly, forsooth, I find it hard to believe him the same man.
pg25344|easy|I know thee, Hester; for I behold the token.
pg25344|hard|These, perhaps, if more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser medium, and have clogged the spiritual sense.
pg25344|medium|She had an undulating, but, oftentimes, a sharp and irregular movement.
pg25344|easy|The crowd, meanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder.
pg25344|easy|For, Hester, I am a dying man.
pg25344|easy|Thou wouldst not, yonder, in the forest!
pg25344|medium|Surely, surely, we have ransomed one another, with all this woe!

pg27761|hard|It is not, nor it cannot come to, good: But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
pg27761|hard|And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request.
pg27761|hard|Come, come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
pg27761|hard|You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: O, old friend!
pg27761|easy|Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.
pg27761|easy|We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us.
pg27761|medium|To a nunnery, go; go; go.
pg27761|hard|Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.
pg27761|hard|Both here, and hence, pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
pg27761|hard|But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: O, step between her and her fighting soul.
pg27761|easy|Here is, therefore, a play upon the words.
pg27761|hard|Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.
pg27761|hard|O, Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions!
pg27761|easy|Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
pg27761|easy|Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
pg27761|easy|Then, venom, to thy work.

pg64317|easy|I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.
pg64317|easy|The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.
pg64317|medium|He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome.
pg64317|medium|His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible.
pg64317|medium|The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there.
pg64317|hard|Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.
pg64317|medium|The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer.
pg64317|hard|Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.
pg64317|easy|Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.
pg64317|hard|When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed.
pg64317|hard|There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.
pg64317|easy|Listen, George, listen to me.
pg64317|medium|Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.
pg64317|hard|With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the pool.
pg64317|medium|Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.
